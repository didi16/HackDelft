Hack Delft

The code here presented was developed during TU DELFT's hackathon. 
Our case was sponsored by KPMG and in its essence consists of a news classifier that can be improved with user's input. The end goal was  to remove the need of using hand-crafted filters that group the news by content. Also, our grouping method could be used to allow a more user friendly experience while browsing throught KPMG cyber security trends index.

The process starts with extracting news from the web using a provided API and then two approaches are available. One unsupervised approach, which will cluster the incoming news based on their similarity and generate classes. One supervised approach, where a  Random Forrest Classifier trained on 3204 news will attribute one of the six existing classes to the news. The user is allowed to confirm whether the prediction is right or wrong. In case that it is wrong he has the opportunity of correctly label the data and improve the model!

Participating in this Hackathon was an amazing experience that pushed me to my limits. It was necessary to design and create a product that could be used in the real world and, very important, add new value to what already existed. Everything in less than 24hours! This really makes me think out of the box and be creative. I also really appreciated the fact that I had to discover new technologies and frameworks.
